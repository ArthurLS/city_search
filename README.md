# City Search

Graneet test project. 3 algo questions and a mini city search project.

## Test the algorithms
- For 1 only one example will run, uncomment at the end of the file for more
- For 2 every case will run. Add longuest0Suite(N) a the end of the file to run some more.
- algo3.js is empty. I took 15min to think about it and, appart from the recursive solution, I think an algo like dijkstra but for longest path would fit very well here.

## Client and server setup

Run these commands in both server and client folders to install the modules and start up the project :
```
npm i
npm start
```

## Notes

- setupdb.js, it's a failed attempt to quickly setup a sqlite DB for the project
